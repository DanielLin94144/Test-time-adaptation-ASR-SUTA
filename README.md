# SpeechTent: On-the-fly Unsupervised Test-time Adaptation for Automatic Speech Recognition
[On-going project]
Given a CTC-based trained ASR model with layer normalization layer, we can adapt our model to one utterance by **entropy minimization**. This method has below advantages:
* Efficient adaptation for one single instance
* DONT need source data
