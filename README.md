# Listen, Adapt, Better WER: Source-free Single-utterance Test-timeAdaptation for Automatic Speech Recognition [On-going project]
### Introduction
Given a CTC-based trained ASR model with layer normalization layer, we can adapt our model to one utterance by unsupervised objectives (such as entropy minimization, class correlation minimization). 

Our proposed method, **Single-Utterance Test-time Adaptation (SUTA)**, has below advantages:
* Efficient adaptation for one single utterance
* DONT need source data
* Only need about 0.1s per 1s utterance for 10 steps adaptation
