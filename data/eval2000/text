sw_4484-A_001254-002752 WELL I HAVE THREE CHILDREN AND I HAVE USED VARIOUS DIFFERENT KINDS OF DAYCARE OVER THE YEARS (%HESITATION) I THINK ACTUALLY THE HARDEST TIME TO FIND GOOD DAYCARE IS WHEN YOUR BABY IS VERY YOUNG
sw_4484-A_002752-003579 (%HESITATION) BECAUSE THEY CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT IS GOING ON THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAD WAS WHEN I WAS WORKING
sw_4484-A_003579-003989 WHEN MY (%HESITATION) OLDEST CHILD WAS A BABY
sw_4484-A_003989-004892 AND I THOUGHT AND I (JUS-) I USED THE LADY NEXT DOOR TO ME AND YOU KNOW IT WAS CLOSE-BY AND IT WAS CONVENIENT AND HE ALWAYS CAME HOME CLEAN AND WHAT HAVE YOU
sw_4484-A_004892-005814 BUT I DISCOVERED THAT HER WAY OF HANDLING CONFLICTS BETWEEN LITTLE KIDS ONCE THEY STARTED CRAWLING AND STUFF WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I WANTED
sw_4484-A_005814-006427 FOR MY SON SHE ALWAYS INTERFERED AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU HAVE (%HESITATION) (%HESITATION)
sw_4484-A_006427-007055 YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF KIDS AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ALL TAKEN CARE OF AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU CANNOT LET
sw_4484-A_007055-007347 THINGS ESCALATE BUT
sw_4484-A_007347-007954 SHE WOULD DEPRIVE THE ENVIRONMENT IN ORDER FOR THE KIDS NOT TO FIGHT AND THEN JUST STICK THEM IN FRONT OF THE T V
sw_4484-A_007954-008686 AND I (I-) YOU KNOW AND I DID NOT DISCOVER THAT UNTIL LATER ON AND BUT IT WAS SUMMER I DECIDED TO QUIT WORKING ANYWAY BUT
sw_4484-A_008686-009862 I DECIDED THAT ACTUALLY (THE-) THE HARDEST TIME TO FIND DAYCARE IS UP TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS OLD MAYBE FROM SIX WEEKS TO SIX MONTHS YOU CAN DO IT BUT ONCE YOUR BABY STARTS CRAWLING AND STUFF FROM THEN UNTIL THEY REALLY START TALKING
sw_4484-A_009862-010221 IT IS (I-) I FIND THAT IS THE HARDEST TIME TO FIND
sw_4484-A_010221-010612 REALLY (COMFORT-) RIGHT NOW THEY ARE SEVEN FIVE AND THREE
sw_4484-A_010612-010753 YEAH
sw_4484-A_010753-011293 SO BUT THEN ONCE THEY ARE EIGHTEEN MONTHS OLD YOU CAN OFTEN FIND GOOD PRESCHOOL
sw_4484-A_011293-011736 KINDS OF SITUATIONS BUT I THINK IT IS REAL IMPORTANT TO CHECK
sw_4484-A_011736-012454 HOW YOU WANT SOCIAL INTERACTIONS HANDLED AND HOW THE SCHOOL OR DAYCARE DOES IT
sw_4484-A_012454-013186 YOU KNOW THE OTHER THINGS TO CHECK THEY ALWAYS TELL YOU YOU KNOW CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS CONTINUITY OF CARE THAT YOUR CHILD IS GONNA
sw_4484-A_013186-013602 HAVE SOMEBODY THAT THEY CAN MAKE AN ATTACHMENT TO AND STICK WITH
sw_4484-A_013969-014828 WELL I USED SOMETHING SORT OF LIKE A DAYCARE CENTER (%HESITATION) FOR MY YOUNGEST ONE WHEN I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL LAST YEAR
sw_4484-A_014828-015541 AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS PARTIALLY FUNDED BY THE SCHOOL AND IT WAS AT A Y W C A
sw_4484-A_015541-016138 AND THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAD THERE ACTUALLY WAS THAT THEY
sw_4484-A_016138-017296 THEY TRY TO PROVIDE CONTINUITY OF CARE BUT THEY KEPT CHANGING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE PROGRAM YOU KNOW PEOPLE WOULD DROP OUT OF SCHOOL AND SO THEIR KIDS WOULD DROP OUT OF THE PROGRAM AND (THEY) (SENT) (ME) (ON) AND SO
sw_4484-A_017296-017799 AND SOMEBODY WOULD GET SICK AND THEY WOULD START SHIFTING PEOPLE AROUND FROM ONE ROOM TO THE NEXT
sw_4484-A_017799-018025 AND (%HESITATION)
sw_4484-A_018025-018864 THAT WAS REALLY TOUGH ON MY SON BECAUSE HE HAD MADE A REAL STRONG ATTACHMENT WITH ONE PARTICULAR CAREGIVER AND THEN THAT ONE
sw_4484-A_018864-019737 GOT SWITCHED OUT OF HIS ROOM BUT HE HE ADJUSTED TO IT PRETTY WELL BUT THAT THAT WAS TOUGH ON HIM AND THEY THEY
sw_4484-A_019737-020346 DID THEIR BEST NOT TO DO THAT IT WAS JUST THAT YOU KNOW THEY KEPT HAVING (%HESITATION)
sw_4484-A_020514-021377 BECAUSE THEY WERE USING STUDENTS TO PROVIDE THE CARE AND BECAUSE OF THE POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO WERE USING THE CARE THAT BECAME
sw_4484-A_021377-021835 (%HESITATION) MUCH MORE OF AN ISSUE WITH THEM YEAH
sw_4484-A_022156-022742 WELL IN OTHER WORDS THEY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME PERSON TAKING CARE OF THEM
sw_4484-A_022742-023264 OKAY SO THAT THEY THE SAME FAITH THE SAME AND SEE DIFFERENT PEOPLE EVEN IF
sw_4484-A_023264-023874 A DAYCARE CENTER OR A HOME OR A SCHOOL OR SOMETHING HAS A PHILOSOPHY
sw_4484-A_023874-024203 AS TO HOW TO DEAL WITH CERTAIN KINDS OF SITUATIONS
sw_4484-A_024203-024775 NOT EVERY INDIVIDUAL APPLIES THAT PHILOSOPHY IN THE SAME WAY
sw_4484-A_024775-025197 AND SO IT IS NICE FOR KIDS TO HAVE
sw_4484-A_025197-025438 A CHANCE TO GET USED TO
sw_4484-A_025438-025610 HOW THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN
sw_4484-A_025610-026341 SO THAT THEY (THEY-) (NE-) (AN-) THEY HAVE A (CHAN-) THEY CAN START LEARNING TO PREDICT A LITTLE BIT I KNOW REAL LITTLE ONES DO NOT DO VERY MUCH PREDICTING BUT
sw_4484-A_026341-026689 THEY SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO SAY (%HESITATION) YES OKAY
sw_4484-A_026689-027157 I AM GONNA GET THERE AND THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN AND THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN AND IF I DO THIS
sw_4484-A_027157-027702 (AN-) THAT IS GONNA (HAPPE-) YOU (KNO-) THEY SHOULD HAVE A WAY TO BE ABLE TO PREDICT WHAT IS GONNA HAPPEN TO THEM
sw_4484-A_027702-028450 AND (%HESITATION) IF YOU KEEP CHANGING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE THEN THEY HAVE (NO-) NOTHING TO HOLD ON TO
sw_4484-A_028450-028958 AND IT IS HARD ENOUGH ON LITTLE ONES TO BE AWAY FROM THE PARENTS
sw_4484-A_028958-029714 (%HESITATION) AND THEN DIFFERENT CHILDREN TOO HAVE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT WAYS OF HANDLING IT ONE THING
sw_4484-A_029714-029863 I THINK THAT PARENTS REALLY (D-)
sw_4484-B_000000-000645 OKAY (%HESITATION) I PERSONALLY DO NOT KNOW A WHOLE LOT I AM (O-) I AM TWENTY-ONE YEARS OLD AND I DO NOT HAVE ANY CHILDREN

sw_4520-A_000000-000936 WELL I USED TO BE A TEACHER AND I THINK THERE ARE MANY THINGS WRONG WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AND THAT IS WHY I GOT OUT OF TEACHING
sw_4520-A_001351-002284 WELL (%HESITATION) I THINK THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THERE IS JUST NOT ENOUGH DISCIPLINE AND THE CLASSES ARE TOO BIG
sw_4520-A_002284-002512 BECAUSE (%HESITATION)
sw_4520-A_002801-003175 KIDS JUST GET AWAY WITH TOO MUCH AND THERE IS NOT
sw_4520-A_003175-003583 REALLY THAT MUCH THAT A TEACHER CAN DO BECAUSE
sw_4520-A_003583-004600 (%HESITATION) THE ADMINISTRATION IS WORRIED ABOUT THE BIG PROBLEMS ABOUT (%HESITATION) YOU KNOW KIDS BRINGING GUNS TO SCHOOL
sw_4520-A_004600-005073 AND THEY DO NOT HAVE TIME TO WORRY ABOUT THE (P-) THE PROBLEMS OF
sw_4520-A_005073-005566 OF MANAGEMENT THAT THEY USED TO BE ABLE TO WORRY ABOUT
sw_4520-A_018114-019282 WELL I THINK (N-) THE PROBLEM WITH THAT THE PROBLEM I HAD BECAUSE WHEN I WENT INTO TEACHING I DECIDED THAT I WAS JUST GONNA BE YOU KNOW THE PERFECT CREATIVE TEACHER AND
sw_4520-A_019282-019810 (%HESITATION) MY KIDS WERE GONNA JUST THINK THAT LEARNING WAS FUN AND
sw_4520-A_019810-020072 I WAS TEACHING EIGHTH GRADE

sw_4520-A_020669-020935 WELL THIS WAS IN SOUTH CAROLINA
sw_4520-A_021035-021377 BUT ANYWAY THE PROBLEM THAT I HAD
sw_4520-A_021377-022206 WAS (%HESITATION) MY STUDENTS DID NOT REALLY KNOW HOW TO RESPOND TO THAT AND
sw_4520-A_022206-022416 THEY BASICALLY
sw_4520-A_022416-022979 DID NOT THEY DID NOT APPRECIATE EVERYTHING I WAS TRYING TO DO FOR THEM BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE
sw_4520-A_022979-024007 LEARNING GAMES ALL THE TIME AND I TRIED TO DO JUST FUN THINGS AND MAKE IT INTERESTING AND DO CREATIVE THINKING
sw_4520-A_024007-024778 JUST ALL KINDS OF THINGS AND THEY JUST TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME AND THEY WALKED ALL OVER ME AND I WAS NEVER
sw_4520-A_024778-025553 ABLE TO ESTABLISH ANY KIND OF DISCIPLINE BECAUSE I STARTED OUT BEING TOO NICE
sw_4520-A_026280-027537 WELL SEE THAT IS THE THING IS I DO NOT THINK THAT THEY DO RESPECT TEACHERS AND I AM SAYING THAT THAT THAT WELL JUST THAT (THE) ADMINISTRATION IN MY SCHOOL DID NOT GIVE ME ANY SUPPORT AND IT IS LIKE AFTER
sw_4520-A_027537-027964 YOU KNOW (THAT) THE STUDENTS WERE ALREADY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ME
sw_4520-A_027964-028589 (%HESITATION) THEY JUST TOLD ME TO JUST CRACK DOWN AND THEN THEY WOULD NOT SUPPORT ME IN THAT
sw_4520-A_028589-029532 AND THEY JUST TOLD THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT THESE STUDENTS WOULD RESPOND WOULD BE IF I HAD A COMPLETELY STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT AND I WAS MISERABLE
sw_4520-A_029532-029741 DOING THAT
sw_4520-B_000264-000358 UM-HUM

sw_4520-B_004519-004651 YEAH
sw_4520-B_005453-006093 (WE-) (WE-) (I-) I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT (%HESITATION) (I-) IF YOU START CONCERNING YOURSELF MORE WITH DISCIPLINE I THINK (%HESITATION)
sw_4520-B_006093-007351 I THINK TEACHERS' MAIN GOAL SHOULD BE MORE INSTEAD OF WORRYING ABOUT DISCIPLINE IS GETTING (T-) (TH-) STUDENTS OR YOU KNOW KIDS INTERESTED IN LEARNING BECAUSE AS I CAN RECALL WHERE I WENT TO GO (GO-) TO SCHOOL (%HESITATION)
sw_4520-B_007351-008827 MOST OF THE TEACHERS WERE JUST BASICALLY BENT ON EITHER TRYING TO DISCIPLINE YOU AND THEN FORCE YOU TO GO THROUGH THIS MATERIAL AND SHOW NO REALLY INTEREST I MEAN IN TO MAKING IT INTERESTING OR FUN FUN AND AND SCHOOL WERE TWO OXYMORON TYPE OF WORD
sw_4520-B_008827-009403 AND I THINK THAT WAS BASICALLY THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY WERE (T-) MORE (INTERES-) THEY BUILT UP THIS TYPE OF (%HESITATION)
sw_4520-B_009403-010649 I DO NOT KNOW (%HESITATION) THIS MIGHT NOT BE IN YOUR CASE BUT AT LEAST WHERE I WENT TO SCHOOL (%HESITATION) A SUPERIORITY COMPLEX WHERE THEY HAD TO BE ALWAYS MORE INTELLIGENT THAN THEIR STUDENTS AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR STUDENTS THEY FELT MORE INTIMIDATED
sw_4520-B_010649-011188 WHEN (%HESITATION) PEOPLE WOULD ASK YOU KNOW QUESTIONS THAT THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES SO THEN RATHER THAN
sw_4520-B_011188-012368 DOING THIS THEY WOULD EITHER YOU KNOW RIDICULE THE STUDENT OR TELL THEM TO SHUT UP OR YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT WHAT WE ARE COVERING WE ARE DOING THIS AND SO CERTAIN KIDS WHO WOULD BE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING DIFFERENT (%HESITATION) AVENUES WHERE JUST BASICALLY SHUNTED BECAUSE
sw_4520-B_012368-013337 YOU KNOW (THERE-) YOU KNOW (IT-) THEY WERE ALL MORE CONCERNED THAT EVERYBODY FOLLOWS ALONG A CERTAIN PATH ALTHOUGH I AGREE THAT DISCIPLINING IS (%HESITATION) IMPORTANT (%HESITATION)
sw_4520-B_013337-013907 -ND ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE ARE (IN-) (%HESITATION) IN DIFFERENT AREAS WHERE KIDS ARE ALREADY GROWN TO
sw_4520-B_013907-014893 (%HESITATION) A POINT OF REBELLION WHERE GUNS AS YOU MENTIONED BUT (%HESITATION) IN GENERAL (%HESITATION) IN CERTAIN AREAS I THINK IF (I-) IF THEY STARTED EARLIER MAYBE NOT IN JUST
sw_4520-B_014893-015568 THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL BUT I MEAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MAYBE YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SWITCHBLADES INSTEAD OF GUNS (%HESITATION)
sw_4520-B_015568-016361 THAT THE STUDENTS WOULD YOU KNOW IF THE TEACHERS GOT KIDS INTERESTED MORE INTO LEARNING RATHER THAN BICKERING YOU WOULD (%HESITATION) ELIMANATE THESE
sw_4520-B_016361-016597 PSEUDO-REBEL ROLES THAT ARE CREATED
sw_4520-B_016597-018042 BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF THE TEACHER SAYS DO NOT DO THIS AND THEN KIDS DO IT AND ESPECIALLY THAT AGE THEY WANT TO BE A REBEL SO THEY ARE DIFFERENT THEY PROVE THEMSELVES BY YOU KNOW (%HESITATION) (%HESITATION) GOING AGAINST THE ESTABLISHMENT TYPE OF THING (%HESITATION) WHAT DO YOU THINK
