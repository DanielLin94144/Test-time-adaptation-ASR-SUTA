sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 12.54  27.52 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  WELL I HAVE THREE CHILDREN AND I HAVE USED VARIOUS DIFFERENT KINDS OF DAYCARE OVER THE YEARS (%HESITATION) I THINK ACTUALLY THE HARDEST TIME TO FIND GOOD DAYCARE IS WHEN YOUR BABY IS VERY YOUNG 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 27.52  35.79 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  (%HESITATION) BECAUSE THEY CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT IS GOING ON THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAD WAS WHEN I WAS WORKING 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 35.79  39.89 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  WHEN MY (%HESITATION) OLDEST CHILD WAS A BABY 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 39.89  48.92 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  AND I THOUGHT AND I (JUS-) I USED THE LADY NEXT DOOR TO ME AND YOU KNOW IT WAS CLOSE-BY AND IT WAS CONVENIENT AND HE ALWAYS CAME HOME CLEAN AND WHAT HAVE YOU 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 48.92  58.14 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  BUT I DISCOVERED THAT HER WAY OF HANDLING CONFLICTS BETWEEN LITTLE KIDS ONCE THEY STARTED CRAWLING AND STUFF WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I WANTED 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 58.14  64.27 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  FOR MY SON SHE ALWAYS INTERFERED AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU HAVE (%HESITATION) (%HESITATION) 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 64.27  70.55 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF KIDS AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ALL TAKEN CARE OF AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU CANNOT LET 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 70.55  73.47 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  THINGS ESCALATE BUT 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 73.47  79.54 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  SHE WOULD DEPRIVE THE ENVIRONMENT IN ORDER FOR THE KIDS NOT TO FIGHT AND THEN JUST STICK THEM IN FRONT OF THE T V 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 79.54  86.86 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  AND I (I-) YOU KNOW AND I DID NOT DISCOVER THAT UNTIL LATER ON AND BUT IT WAS SUMMER I DECIDED TO QUIT WORKING ANYWAY BUT 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 86.86  98.62 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  I DECIDED THAT ACTUALLY (THE-) THE HARDEST TIME TO FIND DAYCARE IS UP TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS OLD MAYBE FROM SIX WEEKS TO SIX MONTHS YOU CAN DO IT BUT ONCE YOUR BABY STARTS CRAWLING AND STUFF FROM THEN UNTIL THEY REALLY START TALKING 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 98.62 102.21 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  IT IS (I-) I FIND THAT IS THE HARDEST TIME TO FIND 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 102.21 106.12 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  REALLY (COMFORT-) RIGHT NOW THEY ARE SEVEN FIVE AND THREE 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 106.12 107.53 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  YEAH 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 107.53 112.93 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  SO BUT THEN ONCE THEY ARE EIGHTEEN MONTHS OLD YOU CAN OFTEN FIND GOOD PRESCHOOL 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 112.93 117.36 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  KINDS OF SITUATIONS BUT I THINK IT IS REAL IMPORTANT TO CHECK 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 117.36 124.54 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  HOW YOU WANT SOCIAL INTERACTIONS HANDLED AND HOW THE SCHOOL OR DAYCARE DOES IT 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 124.54 131.86 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  YOU KNOW THE OTHER THINGS TO CHECK THEY ALWAYS TELL YOU YOU KNOW CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS CONTINUITY OF CARE THAT YOUR CHILD IS GONNA 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 131.86 136.02 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  HAVE SOMEBODY THAT THEY CAN MAKE AN ATTACHMENT TO AND STICK WITH 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 139.69 148.28 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  WELL I USED SOMETHING SORT OF LIKE A DAYCARE CENTER (%HESITATION) FOR MY YOUNGEST ONE WHEN I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL LAST YEAR 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 148.28 155.42 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS PARTIALLY FUNDED BY THE SCHOOL AND IT WAS AT A Y W C A 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 155.42 161.38 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  AND THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAD THERE ACTUALLY WAS THAT THEY 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 161.38 172.96 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  THEY TRY TO PROVIDE CONTINUITY OF CARE BUT THEY KEPT CHANGING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE PROGRAM YOU KNOW PEOPLE WOULD DROP OUT OF SCHOOL AND SO THEIR KIDS WOULD DROP OUT OF THE PROGRAM AND (THEY) (SENT) (ME) (ON) AND SO 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 172.96 177.99 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  AND SOMEBODY WOULD GET SICK AND THEY WOULD START SHIFTING PEOPLE AROUND FROM ONE ROOM TO THE NEXT 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 177.99 180.25 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  AND (%HESITATION) 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 180.25 188.64 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  THAT WAS REALLY TOUGH ON MY SON BECAUSE HE HAD MADE A REAL STRONG ATTACHMENT WITH ONE PARTICULAR CAREGIVER AND THEN THAT ONE 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 188.64 197.37 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  GOT SWITCHED OUT OF HIS ROOM BUT HE HE ADJUSTED TO IT PRETTY WELL BUT THAT THAT WAS TOUGH ON HIM AND THEY THEY 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 197.37 203.46 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  DID THEIR BEST NOT TO DO THAT IT WAS JUST THAT YOU KNOW THEY KEPT HAVING (%HESITATION) 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 205.14 213.77 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  BECAUSE THEY WERE USING STUDENTS TO PROVIDE THE CARE AND BECAUSE OF THE POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO WERE USING THE CARE THAT BECAME 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 213.77 218.35 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  (%HESITATION) MUCH MORE OF AN ISSUE WITH THEM YEAH 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 221.56 227.42 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  WELL IN OTHER WORDS THEY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME PERSON TAKING CARE OF THEM 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 227.42 232.64 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  OKAY SO THAT THEY THE SAME FAITH THE SAME AND SEE DIFFERENT PEOPLE EVEN IF 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 232.64 238.74 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  A DAYCARE CENTER OR A HOME OR A SCHOOL OR SOMETHING HAS A PHILOSOPHY 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 238.74 242.03 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  AS TO HOW TO DEAL WITH CERTAIN KINDS OF SITUATIONS 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 242.03 247.75 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  NOT EVERY INDIVIDUAL APPLIES THAT PHILOSOPHY IN THE SAME WAY 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 247.75 251.97 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  AND SO IT IS NICE FOR KIDS TO HAVE 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 251.97 254.38 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  A CHANCE TO GET USED TO 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 254.38 256.10 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  HOW THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 256.10 263.41 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  SO THAT THEY (THEY-) (NE-) (AN-) THEY HAVE A (CHAN-) THEY CAN START LEARNING TO PREDICT A LITTLE BIT I KNOW REAL LITTLE ONES DO NOT DO VERY MUCH PREDICTING BUT 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 263.41 266.90 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  THEY SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO SAY (%HESITATION) YES OKAY 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 266.90 271.57 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  I AM GONNA GET THERE AND THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN AND THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN AND IF I DO THIS 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 271.57 277.03 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  (AN-) THAT IS GONNA (HAPPE-) YOU (KNO-) THEY SHOULD HAVE A WAY TO BE ABLE TO PREDICT WHAT IS GONNA HAPPEN TO THEM 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 277.03 284.50 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  AND (%HESITATION) IF YOU KEEP CHANGING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE THEN THEY HAVE (NO-) NOTHING TO HOLD ON TO 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 284.50 289.58 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  AND IT IS HARD ENOUGH ON LITTLE ONES TO BE AWAY FROM THE PARENTS 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 289.58 297.15 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  (%HESITATION) AND THEN DIFFERENT CHILDREN TOO HAVE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT WAYS OF HANDLING IT ONE THING 
sw_4484 A sw_4484_A 297.15 298.63 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  I THINK THAT PARENTS REALLY (D-) 
sw_4484 B sw_4484_B 0.00   6.45 <O,sw,F,sw-F>  OKAY (%HESITATION) I PERSONALLY DO NOT KNOW A WHOLE LOT I AM (O-) I AM TWENTY-ONE YEARS OLD AND I DO NOT HAVE ANY CHILDREN
